### HELLO EVERYONE! 🦦

I’m **Carlos Flores**, a software engineer from Francisco Morazán, Honduras.

I’m currently focused on full-stack development and eager to dive into AI development. Right now, I’m working on a library management system for the physics faculty, which has been an exciting challenge.

I’m passionate about software development and the endless possibilities it offers to create innovative solutions from anywhere. I’m open to internships opportunities, so feel free to reach out!
